# (Ma)x's (Sh)ell - MASH
I wanted to know how a shell worked, so I made one. Also, I'm pretty new to C.

## How to build
```make build```

## Features (beyond running binaries)
A simple list of possible commands
quit/exit - quits the shell 
cd - Changes directory (Which is a C function, not a binary like I was expecting, but in retrospect, it makes sense
whatsthebestshell - Just test it (or look at the source code, if you are boring)
